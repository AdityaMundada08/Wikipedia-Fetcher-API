# Wikipedia-Fetcher-API
Developed a web crawler platform to query over Wikipedia. The API can help you get basic information for any query. Results are served in two formats, JSON as well as HTML format. The client-side has been implemented using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and the Spring MVC framework with JAVA was used for the server-side. Backend process involves calling [wikipedia.org](https://www.wikipedia.org/) to fetch the raw data, which is eventually parsed and cleaned to get the output. Tested the project for 300+ queries like “India”, “America”, “Einstein” etc. It crawls through Wikipedia and displays the queried information through the web application within a time frame of 30 seconds. The project was initially only based on server-side applications. But now the client-side has also been developed by me.

This was a month long project that I built during the summers of 2021 in June. This was my first self made project and it was a bit challenging at first.

Edit: The files have been added recently from the local desktop.
